# Export to otcoregen farm (instructions)

# Please provide datasets to be shared with Open Targets partners as described below.
# Data not shared in this manner may remain unavailable to the partners until corrected.
# Include 1) short, one-sentence description of the dataset for the intranet page & 2) a brief README/description of the files being shared and how they relate to one another.
# 
# Copy individual releases to sub-directories of your project.
# /lustre/scratch118/opentargets/opentargets/OTAR***/share/
#   E.g., Release #1:
# /lustre/scratch118/opentargets/opentargets/OTAR***/share/Release_1
# Place subsequent releases in different directories.
# /lustre/scratch118/opentargets/opentargets/OTAR***/share/Release_2
# /lustre/scratch118/opentargets/opentargets/OTAR***/share/Release_3
# Ensure that all the copied data is group read/writeable.
# chmod â€“R 770 /lustre/scratch118/opentargets/opentargets/OTAR***/share/Release_1
# 
# 
# NOTES:
#   Data not copied to a directory under /share/ may go unnoticed or completely deleted without warning, thus remain unavailable for sharing.
# 
# Data presented for sharing may be archived off the system once it is available to the partners. If you would like to retain access to the uploaded data during the project, it should be stored elsewhere.
# 
# Any questions, please speak to either Sarah Young (sy3@sanger.ac.uk) or Stuart Horswell (sh40@sanger.ac.uk) for more details.
